### 2. **Progressive Learning Path**
The test files are structured to build your knowledge incrementally:
- Start with basic assertions and interactions
- Progress to advanced fixtures and custom test setup
- Master complex scenarios like iframe handling and dialog management

### 3. **Best Practices Implementation**
Learn industry-standard practices:
- **Stable locator strategies** using accessibility roles
- **Test isolation** with proper setup/teardown
- **Maintainable test architecture** with custom fixtures
- **Effective assertion patterns** including soft assertions

### 4. **Production-Ready Patterns**
All examples follow patterns suitable for enterprise test suites:
- Configurable test environments
- Parallel test execution
- Comprehensive reporting
- CI/CD integration ready
